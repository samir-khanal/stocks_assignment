# stocks_assignment
# Define 10 Stocks, randomly generate their price (range from 1000 to 10000)
# Write to csv file using python csv module

# Read that csv file using pandas
# Add new column to that data frame which says if we can buy this stock(use whatever you logic you want)
# export to output.csv

# stocks = [
#     {"name":"NHCL","price":randint(100,10000)},
#     {"name":"NHCL","price":randint(100,10000)},
#     {"name":"NHCL","price":randint(100,10000)},
#     {"name":"NHCL","price":randint(100,10000)},
#     ......
#     {"name":"NHCL","price":randint(100,10000)} # 10s

# ]
# csv.DictWrite() -> stocks.csv file save......

# Using pandas read pd.read_csv('stocks.csv')
# df['Can Buy'] = Logic
# df.to_csv('csv_file.csv')

# Optional : Push this code along with output.csv and stocks.csv to github(make your repo public)
# and send me a link
#Highly Encouraged : Uses of lambda or classes would be highlyÂ encouraged
